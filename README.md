    Adult Body Mass Index Calculator         
Filename:
    bmi_cal.py
Problem Statement:
    Assuming your weight in kilogram and height in meters  
    Calculate your BMI value and print it ?
    Take the height and weight of the user from input 
Hint: 
    How to caltulate your BMI ?
    Divide your weight in kilograms (kg) by your height in metres (m)
    Then divide the answer by your height again to get your BMI

This would be helpful since you need to convert your own height into meters 
    1 Feet = 0.3048 m
    1 Inch = 0.0254 m

Name: 
    Ride Cost Calculator         
Filename:
    ridecost_cal.py
Problem Statement:
    Assume you travel 80 km to and fro in a day. 
    Cost of Diesel per litre is 80 INR 
    Your vehicle Fuel Average is 18 km/litre. 
    Now calculate the cost of driving per day to office.
    Take the distance travelled, cost of diesel and Fuel Average from input 
Hint:    
    fuel_consumption = (travelling_km / vehicle_fuel_avg)
    cost_per_day = (diesel_cost * fuel_consumption)

Filename:
    salary.py
Problem Statement:
    Clean the Messy salary into integers for Data Processing
    salary = '$876,001'
    
    Remove the $
    Remove the ,
    Convert the string into integer
Hint: 
    We can use slicing concept to remove $ or replace() method 
    We can use the split and join to remove the , comma
    We can use the int() typecast to convert into integer
